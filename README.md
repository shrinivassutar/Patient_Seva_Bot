# Engineering Exploration Lab Project: Bot Prototype

Welcome to the Engineering Exploration Lab project repository! This project involves the creation of a bot prototype developed during our first year of engineering.

## Overview

During our first year in the Engineering Exploration Lab, we embarked on creating a multifunctional bot prototype. This bot features:

- Mask dispensing mechanism using a crank piston mechanism powered by a DC motor
- Sanitizer dispensing functionality facilitated by a suction pump
- Temperature checking capability using an LM35 temperature sensor

## Project Details

The primary components and functionalities of the bot include:

- **Outer Body**: The outer body is constructed using 5mm foam sheet, providing lightweight and durable construction.
- **Mask Dispenser**: Utilizes a crank piston mechanism powered by a DC motor to dispense masks efficiently.
- **Sanitizer Dispenser**: Incorporates a suction pump to dispense sanitizer effectively.
- **Temperature Sensor**: Utilizes an LM35 temperature sensor to accurately measure the temperature of the patient.

## Conceptual Designs

We have designed various conceptual diagrams to illustrate the functionality and design aspects of the bot prototype. Please refer to the diagrams uploaded in the repository for a visual representation of our designs.

## Repository Contents

- **Diagrams**: Contains conceptual design diagrams illustrating the bot's functionalities and design aspects.
